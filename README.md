## Why it exists

browser-search is a SKILL — an instruction set for AI agents like OpenCode,
Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw and others. It teaches your agent how to
search and browse the web using three orchestrated open source tools.

The problem? The web is hostile to automation. Cloudflare, Akamai, DataDome
and other anti-bot systems block simple requests. Modern sites use heavy
JavaScript, lazy loading, and client-side rendering. One single solution
is not enough.

`browser-search` orchestrates **three open source tools** into a single
search and browsing system designed for AI agents. Each tool has its role,
orchestrated by the skill with escalation logic, automatic selection,
and ready-to-use integration:

1. **[SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng)** — metasearch engine for the search phase (multi-source, JSON)
2. **[Camofox](https://github.com/jo-inc/camofox-browser)** — browser navigable via REST API for standard sites
3. **[CloakBrowser](https://github.com/cloakhq/cloakbrowser)** — stealth browser for anti-bot protected sites

The typical flow: the agent first searches with SearXNG, then browses the
results with Camofox (or CloakBrowser if the site is protected).

## Benefits

- **100% free, self-hosted, unlimited.** No API keys to buy, no
  subscriptions, no rate limits. Everything runs on your machine,
  Docker and npm. Unlimited usage, zero cost.

- **Search + browse in one kit.** No manual integration needed.
  Searching and browsing are two distinct phases, both covered.

- **Automatic navigation escalation.** If Camofox gets blocked by
  Cloudflare/Akamai, the agent automatically switches to CloakBrowser.

- **Smart performance.** SearXNG for the search phase (milliseconds).
  Camofox and CloakBrowser are only used to browse the sites that
  actually need it.

- **Automatic agent choice.** The AI agent decides which tool to use:
  SearXNG for initial search, Camofox for browsing, CloakBrowser if
  the site is protected. Zero human intervention.

- **Deep Research mode.** The skill instructs the agent to go beyond
  superficial answers: explore multiple angles, cross-verify sources,
  cover every aspect, and never cut corners.

- **Fully customizable.** The SKILL.md is plain text. You can edit the
  core rules, add your own, remove what you don't need. Adapt it to
  your workflow, your team, your standards.

- **Native stealth.** CloakBrowser automatically detects Cloudflare,
  Akamai, DataDome, Imperva, PerimeterX, and DDoS-Guard challenges,
  and waits for them to resolve before extracting content.

- **Works with any agent.** The SKILL.md is written for OpenCode,
  but the logic is identical for any AI agent. Same README, same
  package.json, everything works everywhere. Just ask your agent
  how to convert the skill for its environment.

## How it works

### Phase 1 — Search with SearXNG

Docker container on `localhost:8080`. Metasearch engine that queries
Google, Wikipedia, Bing, DuckDuckGo and many others simultaneously.
JSON output with titles, snippets, and URLs.

**Example:**

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/search?format=json&q=largest+llm+benchmark+2026"
```

The agent now has a list of URLs to visit and autonomously decides
whether to browse them with Camofox or CloakBrowser based on the site.

### Phase 2 — Browse with Camofox

Docker container on `localhost:9377`. Exposes a full Firefox browser
through a REST API. The agent can create tabs, navigate, click,
scroll, execute arbitrary JavaScript, and structure data.

**Includes:** Mozilla's Readability.js for extracting clean articles,
removing nav, sidebar, and ads (~70% token savings).

**Main commands:**

```bash
# Create tab and navigate
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:9377/tabs" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"userId":"bot","url":"https://example.com"}'

# Read snapshot (accessibility tree)
curl -s "http://localhost:9377/tabs/<tabId>/snapshot?userId=bot"

# Execute JavaScript
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:9377/tabs/<tabId>/evaluate" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CAMOFOX_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"userId":"bot","expression":"document.title"}'
```

### Phase 3 — Browse with CloakBrowser (when Camofox isn't enough)

npm package based on Playwright + `cloakbrowser`. Launches a Chromium
browser with advanced fingerprinting to bypass Cloudflare, Akamai,
DataDome and other anti-bot systems. Automatic challenge detection
with wait and retry.

**Available scripts:**

- `cloak-fetch.mjs` — universal fetch with challenge detection
- `cloak-script.mjs` — custom Playwright script execution

**Example:**

```bash
node scripts/cloak/cloak-fetch.mjs "https://protected-site.com"
node scripts/cloak/cloak-fetch.mjs "https://protected-site.com" --proxy socks5://... --geoip
```

## Why both Camofox and CloakBrowser?

Because speed and stealth are a tradeoff, and the right tool depends on the site.

**Camofox — fast, structured, persistent.**
Camofox wraps Camoufox (a C++-level Firefox fork) in a REST API with an
always-warm browser. After a ~1-3s cold start, every request is near-instant.
Its accessibility snapshots are ~90% smaller than raw HTML, with stable
element refs (e1, e2, ...) for reliable interaction. It handles the ~90% of
sites that don't use advanced anti-bot protection: articles, docs, search
engines, standard web pages.

**CloakBrowser — stealth, anti-bot, on-demand.**
CloakBrowser launches a fresh Chromium instance per request (~1-3s startup
each time). It uses advanced fingerprinting, proxy support, geoip, and
automatic challenge detection to bypass Cloudflare, Akamai, DataDome,
Imperva, PerimeterX, and DDoS-Guard. It is the last resort for the ~10% of
sites that block Camofox.

**Real-world numbers:**
Camoufox (the engine behind Camofox) achieves up to ~92% anti-bot bypass
rate, with ~82% baseline success rate on Cloudflare Turnstile and ~90% on
DataDome — compared to ~60% for standard Playwright stealth approaches.

Camofox handles the fast path. CloakBrowser handles the edge cases. Together
they cover the entire web with no gaps. The agent decides which to use.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johell1ns/browser-search
cd browser-search
npm install
```

Then start the Docker containers:

```bash
# SearXNG (follow the official guide)
# https://docs.searxng.org/admin/installation-docker.html

# Camofox
docker run -d --name camofox-browser --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 9377:9377 \
  -e CAMOFOX_API_KEY=your-key \
  camofox-browser:latest
```

Ask your AI agent to handle the details. Each tool has its own
integrated documentation.

## Environment variables

| Variable             | Required for                      | Default |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|
| `CAMOFOX_API_KEY`    | evaluate, session, cleanup in Camofox | —   |
| `CAMOFOX_ADMIN_KEY`  | Camofox stop endpoint             | —       |

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Social media.** Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Twitter/X
  require login. `browser-search` does not attempt to browse them.
- **Download files.** It is read-only (except for explicit screenshots).
- **Bypass paywalls.** Does not circumvent payment or login systems.
